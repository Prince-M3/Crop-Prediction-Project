Smart Crop Prediction System
Overview
The Smart Crop Prediction System is a web-based tool leveraging machine learning to recommend the most suitable crops and predict yield percentages based on soil and weather data. This project aims to empower farmers with data-driven insights for sustainable agriculture.

Features
Crop Recommendation: Suggests the best crop for given soil and weather conditions.
Yield Prediction: Predicts yield percentage with comparative visualizations.
Interactive Visualizations: Bar charts for comparing user inputs and predicted crop data.
Data-Driven Insights: Helps optimize farming decisions using advanced ML models.
Methodology
Data Collection: Soil and weather data were curated for crop recommendation.
Feature Engineering: Parameters like pH, nitrogen, phosphorus, temperature, and rainfall were analyzed.
Machine Learning: Logistic Regression and Random Forest models for prediction and evaluation.
Evaluation Metrics: Precision, recall, F1 score, and confusion matrix ensure robust performance.
Future Enhancements
Automated soil testing.
Smart irrigation systems with real-time notifications.
Growth monitoring for better decision-making.
